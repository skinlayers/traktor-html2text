traktor-html2text
=================

I DJ with Traktor 2, and I hate trying to get my playlists into Facebook Notes in a simple form. For some reason, I always have issues with line endings when I attempt to copy and paste for a HTML export. So, I made this tool to leverage BeautifulSoup to give me what I wanted. Feel free to fork. This is obviously quick and dirty code.

Software is provided as is. I take no responsibility if you overwrite a .txt file with it.

Requirements: BeautifulSoup4 and Python.

usage: traktor-html2text.py exported_playlist.html
